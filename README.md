# no-shape-left-behind
Giving into my JSB nerd behavior and making a github page for like, player info or whatever... teehee!
a good number of things are unfinished and just straight up broken (where'd the header's bullets go...) from the move from neocites, but right now at 9PM I'm hungry and I don't give a shitttt. I JUST LEARNED HOW TO USE GIT & GITHUB. I'll fix it later lmaoo ðŸ˜­
