  	<p> Welcome to the hip webpage for all shape-players of the <i>"don't want to be left behind"</i> variety. This project aims to make playing Just Shapes & Beats a bit more social, and a bit more fun! It will take a long time to get this project going, but I'll never give up, it's not over til it's over.</p>
